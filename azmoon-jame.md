# The process (According to Ms. Lashkarian):

Dr. Motahari should confirm that ML courses contain the same material (in an email to Dr. Beigy).
Then, Dr. Beigy has some time to decide, either by himself or by consulting with the other professors in the AI group.

The following documents should be sent to Ms. Lashkarian in an email.

    - Karname Arshad
    - Karname Doctora
    - Madrake Zaban
    - Forme Darkhaste Emtehane Jame

Note: Dr. Beigy said that the confirmation will be done after the form is sent officialy to him. Therefore, I should be reading the course of Dr. Jamzad and be prepared for it.

# Status

- Dr Shiry Replied [25 Mehr, 4:30 PM]
- I should send a message to Amirhossein, and ask him about the syllabus of Rohban's course.
- Viewing the list of this term's courses [Maybe I should take another course so that if I fail Image Processing, I can bring that course into the exam!]
