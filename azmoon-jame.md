# The process (According to Ms. Lashkarian):

Dr. Motahari should confirm that ML courses contain the same material (in an email to Dr. Beigy).
Then, Dr. Beigy has some time to decide, either by himself or by consulting with the other professors in the AI group.

The following documents should be sent to Ms. Lashkarian in an email.

    - Karname Arshad
    - Karname Doctora
    - Madrake Zaban
    - Forme Darkhaste Emtehane Jame
