1. Do not do a task EVERY SINGLE DAY. It will be disgusting and boring!
2. Put some hours to develop yourself or have same fun.
3. Don't waste your time for doing garbage things. The outcome is that the others won't give you garbage tasks anymore.
4. Do NOT finish a task before its deadline! They will give you another task!
