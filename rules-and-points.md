1. Do not do a task EVERY SINGLE DAY. It will be disgusting and boring!
2. Put some hours to develop yourself or have same fun.
3. Don't waste your time for doing garbage things. The outcome is that the others won't give you garbage tasks anymore.
4. Do NOT finish a task before its deadline! They will give you another task!
5. Do NOT watch TV series in the morning. Watch one episode in the evening, and don't let yourself be addicted to watching them.
6. Sometimes, just taking a day off makes things much easier.
7. Don't sit in front of a monitor the whole day! You'll get tired (specially, your eyes will!)
8. [IMPORTANT]() Sleeping well is the key to success! Sleep at 9 P.M., Wake up at 6 A.M.
