A temporal point process is a stochastic, or random, process composed of a timeseries of binary events that occur in continuous time (Daley and Vere-Jones, 2003).
They are used to describe data that are localized at a finite set of time points. As
opposed to continuous-valued processes, which can take on any of countless values at
each point in time, a point process can take on only one of two possible values,
indicating whether or not an event occurs at that time. In a sense, this makes the
probability models used to describe point process data relatively easy to express
mathematically. However, point process data are often inappropriately analyzed,
because most standard signal-processing techniques are designed primarily for
continuous-valued data. A fundamental understanding of the probability theory of point
processes is vital for the proper analysis of point process data.
