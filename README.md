# Rules
1. If everything is finished, review.
2. I should have a portfolio containing some open-source projects.
3. I should be aware of the best papers of AI conferences published each year.
4. The main tasks of my day should be: Language Learning + Paper Reading
5. Have a small notebook. While reading, write your unrelated thoughts inside it. (For better concentration)
6. Make your goals "Measurable". Example: Instead of "I wanna be a good student", say "I want my GPA to be at least 18", "For that, I need every course's grade to be at least 18", "To get an 18 in each course, I should do blah blah blah".
7. If you failed to do a task on time, do it at most after 4 or 5 days.
